# 1: Inference and train with existing models and datasets

iMIX provides multiple existing  models in [Model Zoo](../getstart/model_zoo.md), and supports multiple standard datasets, including VQA, GQA, OCR-VQA, RefCOCO, VCR, VisDial,etc. This note will show how to perform common tasks on these existing models and standard datasets, including:

- Use existing models to inference.
- Test existing models on existing datasets.
- Train predefined models on existing datasets.

## Inference with existing models

We provide a visual interface which can show the inference process and result intuitively, use the VQA task (read text in images and answer questions) as an example.

The demo inference with the existing trained models(i.e.  LXMERT model) and the operating procedures are as follows:

1. download the pretrained model weight file of LXMERT [here](https://mega.nz/file/OW5GEIxb#TeXyG2OhV8ZoQ2ESGZOyhONlK0B9p0qwG4bBSkyIX0c) and put it in the directory `imix/openchat/openchat/model_pth/`；

2. set all paths in `config.py`, including pre-training model checkpoint, image, feature extraction files and so on.

3. set the model name in the file `imix/openchat/start_demo.py`；

   ```python
   OpenChat(model="vqa_model", env=WebDemoEnv())
   ```

4. run the demo scripts and get the website of interface.

   ```shell
   python start_demo.py
   ```

   then you can get the website `127.0.0.1:8080`.

5. click on the website, it will show the visual interface.

6. click on the button `Browse` to choose an image in your computer for inference.

7. then ask questions in the dialog box, and it will give you an answer.

## Test existing models on existing datasets

iMIX provides multiple existing models in [Model Zoo](../getstart/model_zoo.md), use [LXMERT](https://github.com/inspur-hsslab/iMIX/tree/master/configs/lxmert/LXMERT.md) as an example. LXMERT support three downstream tasks, choose VQA as an example. Before test the LXMERT model on VQA task, you should do the following two steps:

- download the necessary data file according to the source code paper;
- download the existing model pth file according to the LXMERT readme.

### Prepare datasets

In iMIX, we directly use the  extracted feature files refer to the source code paper. The steps are as follows:

- Download the feature and annotation files like `train.json`, `trainval_ans2label.json`, `train2014_obj36.tsv` and so on. You can download the data file according to the original paper or source code of [LXMERT](https://github.com/inspur-hsslab/iMIX/tree/master/configs/lxmert/LXMERT.md);

- put all those files outside the project directory and symlink the dataset root to `imix/configs/_base_/datasets/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py` as below;

  ```plain
  data_root = '/home/datasets/mix_data/lxmert/'
  feature_path = 'mscoco_imgfeat/'
  annotation_path = 'vqa/'
  ...
  ```


If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files.

```plain
imix
├── configs
│   ├── _base_
│   │   ├── datasets
│   │   │   ├── lxmert
│   │   │   │   ├── lxmert_vqa.py
```

### Prepare model checkpoint

Download the LXMERT model pth file and save it in the directory `tools/work_dirs/`. You can change the path in `imix/configs/_base_/default_runtime.py`.

Model pth file is available [here](https://mega.nz/file/OW5GEIxb#TeXyG2OhV8ZoQ2ESGZOyhONlK0B9p0qwG4bBSkyIX0c). Download the pretrained weights of the existing model in advance, in case the unstable network.

### Test existing models

Assume that you have already finished the two steps. We provide testing scripts for evaluating an existing model on the whole dataset. The following testing environments are supported:

- single GPU
- single node multiple GPUs

Run the script `tools/run.py`  and set the proper parameters to perform testing depending on the testing environment.

```shell
usage: run.py [-h] [--config-file FILE] [--resume-from RESUME_FROM]
                    [--load-from LOAD_FROM] [--eval-only] [--build-submit]
                    [--gpus GPUS] [--machines MACHINES]
                    [--node-rank NODE_RANK] [--work-dir WORK_DIR]
                    [--seed SEED] [--master-port MASTER_PORT]
                    [--master-addr MASTER_ADDR]
```

There are some key arguments, including:

1. `–-config-file`:  set the train config file path;
2. `--eval-only`:  once you set it, it means test mode;
3. `--load-from`:  only loads the model weights;
4. `--gpus `:  set the number of GPU.

Refer to  [tutorial1](../tutorials/Tutorial1-config.md) to see the script parameter in detail.

**Examples**

Test LXMERT model and VQA task through single machine. Config and model checkpoint file is available [here](https://github.com/inspur-hsslab/iMIX/tree/master/configs/lxmert/).

```shell
#single node and single GPU
python tools/run.py \
--config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--eval-only  \
--load-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 1
#single node and multiple GPUs(4)
python tools/run.py \
--config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--eval-only  \
--load-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 4
```

**Note**：

Either in train or test, you can set the batch size by modifying `samples_per_gpu` in the dataset config, which is as below:

```shell
train_data = dict(samples_per_gpu=2, ...)
test_data = dict(samples_per_gpu=2, ...)
```

## Train predefined models on existing datasets

iMIX provides out-of-the-box tools for training models. This section introduce how to train _predefined_ models (under [configs](https://github.com/inspur-hsslab/iMIX/tree/master/configs)) on existing datasets (i.e. VQA).

**Note:** According to the [linear scaling rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677), you need to set the learning rate proportional to the batch size if you use different GPUs or samples per GPU. For example:

 `lr=0.01` for 4 GPUs \* 2 imgs/gpu; `lr=0.08` for 16 GPUs \* 4 imgs/gpu.

### Prepare dataset

Training requires preparing dataset too. See section [Prepare datasets](#prepare-datasets) for details.

### Training on single node

We also use script `tools/run.py` to launch training jobs on a single GPU.
The basic usage is as follows.

```shell
python tools/run.py \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    [optional arguments]
```

There are some other key arguments:

1. `--resume-from`: resume from a previous checkpoint file.

   `resume-from` loads both the model weights and optimizer status, and the epoch is also inherited from the specified checkpoint. It is usually used for resuming the training process that is interrupted accidentally. `--load-from`  only loads the model weights;

2. During training, log files and checkpoints will be saved to the working directory, which can be  set by two methods:

   - specify `work_dir` in the `configs/_base_/default_time.py `file;
   - set `--work-dir` argument in the script.

Optional arguments remain the same as stated [above](#test-existing-models). Refer to [Tutorial1](../tutorials/Tutorial1-config.md) to see the script parameter in detail.

**Examples**

Train LXMERT model and VQA task through single machine. Config and model checkpoint file is available [here](https://github.com/inspur-hsslab/iMIX/tree/master/configs/lxmert/).

```shell
#single node and single GPU
python tools/run.py \
--config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--load-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 1
# or
python tools/run.py \
--config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--resume-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 1

#single node and multiple GPUs(4)
python tools/run.py \
–-config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--load-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 4
# or
python tools/run.py \
–-config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--resume-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 4
```

**Note**：

1. Before training, you can set `by_iter` in the `configs/_base_/schedules/schedule***.py` to determine `train by iter` or `train by epoch`.

   ```python
   # by_iter = True  # the train mode is by iter if true, is by epoch if annotated
   total_epochs = 8  # the num of epoch
   ```

2. Also you can set the `eval_period` in the dataset config to determine the evaluation frequency when `train_by_iter`.

   - eval_period set to 0 means disable evaluation;
   - when the you choose train by epoch mode, it will evaluate the model every epoch in default.

   ```python
   test_data = dict(
       ...
       eval_period=5)  # evaluate the model every 5 batchs in train_by_iter mode.
   ```


### Training on multiple nodes

iMIX relies on `torch.distributed` package for distributed training. Thus, as a basic usage, one can launch distributed training via PyTorch's [launch utility](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility).

**Examples**

Train LXMERT model and VQA task through single machine. Config and model checkpoint file is available [here](https://github.com/inspur-hsslab/iMIX/tree/master/configs/lxmert/).

There is one other key argument: `--node-rank`: the rank of current node(unique per machine).

Optional arguments remain the same as stated [above](#test-existing-models). Refer to [Tutorial1](../tutorials/Tutorial1-config.md) to see the script parameter in detail.

**Examples**

```shell
#machine0
python tools/run.py \
--config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--load-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 8 \
--node-rank 0 \
--machines 2 \
--master-addr 'tcp://' \
--master-port  8889 [--other-flags]
#machine1
python tools/run.py \
--config-file configs/lxmert/lxmert_vqa.py \
--load-from ./work_dirs/lxmert_vqa.pth \
--gpus 8 \
--node-rank 1 \
--machines 2 \
--master-addr 'tcp://' \
--master-port  8889 [--other-flags]
```
